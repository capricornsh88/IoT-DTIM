Deep Learning-based IoT Device Transmission Interval Management
=====================================================================
In this research is about deep learning-based IoT device transmission interval management scheme for enhanced scalability that reduces the redundancy data measurement in LoRa networks. This paper is currently published in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, and we provide the function of device clustering and deep-learning model in this repository. We hope that this page will be helpful to researchers who conducting related researches.
